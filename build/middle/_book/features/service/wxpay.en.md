## Access description

### Method selection

The app payment method is only supported on some phone systems, whereas the web page method is supported by all phone systems. However, the the web page payment produces a pay callback after the order has been submitted to WeChat, unlike like the app method, which does it when the payment produces a result. We recommend that the CP supports both of these access payment methods.

### App payment access

1. See [WeChat Pay (app)](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/api/app/app.php?chapter=9_1) to complete WeChat Pay server access
2. Add a new app to the WeChat Pay background. This app must have a new package name and can't conflict with your own app's package name. It doesn't need to be released, but you must submit an APK to register the app signature corresponding to the new package name
3. Add the values of the newly registered app package name and app signature to the 'package' and 'sign' fields of the manifest.json WeChat Pay interface declaration respectively (you can get the signature value by using [this tool](AppSignGetter.apk) after installing the newly registered APK), as is shown in the interface declaration

### Web page payment access

1. See [WeChat Pay (web)](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/api/H5.php?chapter=9_20) to complete WeChat Pay server access
2. Provide an H5 page that launches payment to the server, this page reads the imported MWEB_URL and will then automatically skip to MWEB_URL
3. Write the URL corresponding to the payment H5 page from step 2 into the URL field of the manifest.json WeChat Pay interface declaration, as shown in the interface declaration

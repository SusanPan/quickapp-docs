# Compiling tools

## Compile and package projects

Run this command in the root directory of the project:

```
npm run build
```

Directory of the compiled project is /build

Generated app path is /dist/.rpk

## Publish packages

You need to create the release directory in the sign directory of the project, copy and paste the private key file private.pem and the certificate file certificate.pem into it.

Required files can be generated by the openssl command, for example:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out certificate.pem
```

Run this command in the root directory of the project:

```
npm run release
```

Generated app path is /dist/.signed.rpk

If you need to use the debug signature temporarily, you can use

```
npm run release -- --debug
```

Attention: The debug signature's safety can't be guaranteed because it is public. Don't use the debug signature to sign the officially released apps.
